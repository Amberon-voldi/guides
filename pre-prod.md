## Project Pre-Planning Guide

### 1. **Understand the Project Scope**
   - **Initial Meeting:** Attend the initial meeting with the client or project stakeholders to gather requirements.
   - **Project Brief:** Create a summary of the project goals, objectives, and key deliverables.

### 2. **Identify Key Features and Components**
   - **Feature Identification:** List all major features the project will need.
   - **Component Breakdown:** Identify the main components of the project, such as frontend, backend, databases, and third-party integrations.

### 3. **Brainstorming Session**
   - **Organize Sessions:** Schedule regular brainstorming sessions with team members from different disciplines (developers, designers, QA).
   - **Feature Analysis:** For each feature, discuss and document the following:
     - **Purpose:** Why is this feature needed?
     - **Functionality:** What does this feature need to do?
     - **User Interaction:** How will users interact with this feature?
   - **Documenting Ideas:** Use a collaborative tool like Miro, Trello, or Google Docs to document ideas and discussions.

### 4. **Detailed Feature Breakdown**
For each identified feature, break it down into smaller tasks and components. Here’s an example of how to do this:

#### Example Feature: **User Authentication System**
   - **User Registration**
     - Purpose: Allow new users to create an account.
     - Steps:
       1. User inputs email, username, and password.
       2. Validate email format and password strength.
       3. Check if email or username already exists.
       4. Store user details securely in the database.
       5. Send confirmation email.
   - **User Login**
     - Purpose: Authenticate users and grant access.
     - Steps:
       1. User inputs email/username and password.
       2. Validate credentials against the database.
       3. Generate and store session/token.
       4. Redirect user to the dashboard.
   - **Password Reset**
     - Purpose: Allow users to reset their password if forgotten.
     - Options:
       1. **Email Link:** Send a password reset link to the user’s email.
       2. **OTP:** Send a one-time password to the user’s email or phone.
     - Workflow:
       1. User requests a password reset.
       2. Send reset link/OTP.
       3. User clicks link/enters OTP.
       4. Validate link/OTP and allow user to set a new password.

### 5. **Workflow Mapping**
   - **Flow Diagrams:** Create flow diagrams for each feature to visualize the user journey and data flow.
     - Tools: Use tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Microsoft Visio.
   - **Example Diagram for User Registration:**
     - Start -> Input Email/Username/Password -> Validate Inputs -> Check for Existing User -> Store User Details -> Send Confirmation Email -> End

### 6. **Implementation Considerations**
   - **Technical Requirements:** List the technical requirements for each feature.
     - Languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.
   - **Dependencies:** Identify dependencies between features and components.
   - **Security Considerations:** Document security measures needed for each feature.
     - E.g., hashing passwords, using HTTPS, implementing CSRF protection.
   - **Performance Considerations:** Plan for performance requirements.
     - E.g., load balancing, database indexing, caching strategies.

### 7. **Documentation**
   - **Feature Specification Documents:** Create detailed specification documents for each feature.
     - Include purpose, functionality, workflows, technical requirements, and security considerations.
   - **Diagrams and Flowcharts:** Attach relevant diagrams and flowcharts to each specification document.

### 8. **Collaboration and Feedback**
   - **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular review meetings with the team to discuss the planned features and workflows.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Create a feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure the plan aligns with their expectations.
